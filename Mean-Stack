Advantages of Mean Stack
Here, are some most prominent reasons for using Mean Stack technology

Allows creating a simple open source solution which can be used to build robust and maintainable solutions.
Helps in rapid development of applications
MEAN is full stack JavaScript which is 100% free. Leverage JavaScript's popularity
Use a uniform language throughout your stack
Uses very low memory footprint/overhead
Helps you to avoid unnecessary groundwork and keeps your application organized
MongoDB is built for the cloud
Node.js simplifies the server layer
MEAN makes code isomorphic

Disadvantages of Mean Stack

MongoDB may be an ideal choice for small to the mid-sized application. However, it is not the best option for large-scale applications
There are no specific general JS coding guidelines
Once you have developed the first site using Mean stack technology, it's really hard to go back to the old approach
It offers poor isolation of server from business logic
You could potentially lose records

Mean Stack Architecture
The primary function of various components of Mean Stack Architecture are as follows:

Angular JS: Accept requests and display results to end user

NodeJS: Handle Client and Server Requests

Express JS: Make requests to Database and return a response

MongoDB: Store and retrieve data.
